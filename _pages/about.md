Hi! I am Kamalesh, a MS CS grad at UMass Amherst. I enjoy working on questions that are broadly encompassed by the framework of Reinforcement Learning (RL). More specifically, the ultimate question I am interested is **What if agents could *never stop learning*?**  What if they could *adapt on the fly*, learn to reuse and update knowledge across months or years of experience—just like humans do? These are very open-ended questions, part of the reason that make them extremely challenging. My long-term research pursuits are driven toward making progress in such broad endeavours. Currently, my interests revolve around the idea of Continual Reinforcement Learning and understanding what existing approaches lack in giving rise to lifelong adaptive behaviour. 

To that end, I am currently associated with [Resource Bounded Reasoning Lab](http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/) under Professor [Slomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/), where I am working on Non-stationarity under the average-reward criterion. Prior to that, I did a research internship in the [Convergence Lab](https://conlabx.com/), where I worked with [Dr Jean-Alexis Delamer](https://people.stfx.ca/jdelamer/) and [Dr James Hughes](https://conlabx.com/lab-members/) in the intersection of genetic programming and RL. I have also worked on problems in adversarial and robust RL along with [Dr Muni Pydi](https://munisreenivas.github.io/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) group at Paris Dauphine University. I was fortunate to spend three wondeful months in Paris supported by the Charpak Scholarship. While I was an undergrad at IIT Madras, I worked with the [Advanced geometric computing lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html) under Professor [Ramanthan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) on GANs.

I am actively looking for research positions/internships for the fall of 2025. If you'd like to talk to me about anything, get in touch!
