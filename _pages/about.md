Hi! I am Kamalesh, a CS grad at UMass Amherst. I enjoy working on questions that are broadly encompassed by the framework of Reinforcement Learning (RL). More specifically, the ultimate question I am interested is **How to design agents that *learn continually*?** How to make them *adapt on the fly*, where they learn to reuse and update their knowledge? These are open-ended questions, part of the reason that make them challenging. My long-term research pursuits are driven toward making progress in such broad endeavours. Currently, my interests revolve around the idea of Continual Reinforcement Learning and understanding what existing approaches lack in giving rise to lifelong adaptive behaviour.

To that end, my master's thesis revolves around these ideas which I am working alongside Professor [Bruno Castro Da Silva](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva/). Prior to that, I was associated with [Resource Bounded Reasoning Lab](http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/) under Professor [Slomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/), where I worked on Non-stationarity under the average-reward criterion. Last summer, I pursued a research internship in the [Convergence Lab](https://conlabx.com/), where I worked with [Dr Jean-Alexis Delamer](https://people.stfx.ca/jdelamer/) and [Dr James Hughes](https://conlabx.com/lab-members/) in the intersection of genetic programming and RL. I have also worked on problems in adversarial and robust RL along with [Dr Muni Pydi](https://munisreenivas.github.io/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) group at Paris Dauphine University. I was fortunate to spend three wondeful months in Paris supported by the Charpak Scholarship. While I was an undergrad at IIT Madras, I worked with the [Advanced geometric computing lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html) under Professor [Ramanthan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) on GANs.

I am in the job market starting May 2026, and looking for challenging roles that tackle the hardest problems either in research or applied settings. Feel free to reach out to me for some deep conversations 😉.
