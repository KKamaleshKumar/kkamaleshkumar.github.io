Hi! I am Kamalesh, a CS grad student at UMass Amherst. I'm advised by Professor [Bruno Castro Da Silva](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva/) who also directs the [Autonomous Learning Laboratory](https://all.cs.umass.edu/). My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, more specifically Continual Reinforcement Learning and understanding what existing approaches lack in giving rise to lifelong adaptive behaviour. 

 Previously, I was associated with [Resource Bounded Reasoning Lab](http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/) under Professor [Slomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/), where I worked on Non-stationarity under the average-reward criterion. Last summer, I pursued a research internship in the [Convergence Lab](https://conlabx.com/), where I worked with [Dr Jean-Alexis Delamer](https://people.stfx.ca/jdelamer/) and [Dr James Hughes](https://conlabx.com/lab-members/) in the intersection of genetic programming and RL. I have also worked on problems in adversarial and robust RL along with [Dr Muni Pydi](https://munisreenivas.github.io/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) group at Paris Dauphine University. I was fortunate to spend three wondeful months in Paris supported by the Charpak Scholarship. While I was an undergrad at IIT Madras, I worked with the [Advanced geometric computing lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html) under Professor [Ramanthan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) on Wasserstein-GANs.

I am in the job market starting May 2026, and looking for challenging roles that tackle the hardest problems either in research or applied settings. More specifically, I am interested about Reinforcement Learning in these two domains: 1. autonomy & robotics 2. post-training & alignment of foundation models. Reach out to me to talk anything about RL (and why it is the key ingredient for AGI 😉).
