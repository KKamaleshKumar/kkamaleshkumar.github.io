Hi! I am Kamalesh, a final year undergrad at IIT Madras. I enjoy working on problems in Machine Learning and specifically in Reinforcement Learning. I am currently working on problems in adversarial and robust RL along with [Prof Muni Pydi](https://munisreenivas.github.io/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) group at [Paris Dauphine University] . I was forutnate to spend three wondeful months in Paris supported by the Charpak Scholarschip. I am also interested in Computer Vision and have been associated with the [Advanced geometric computing lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html) under [Prof Ramanthan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) of IIT Madras. 

I am actively looking for research internships in the summer of 2024. If you'd like to talk to me about anything, hit me mail!
