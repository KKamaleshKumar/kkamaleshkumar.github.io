Hi! I am Kamalesh, a MS CS grad at UMass Amherst. I did my bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. I enjoy working on questions related to Machine Learning and specifically in Reinforcement Learning. Currently, I am associated with the [Convergence Lab](https://conlabx.com/), where I am working in the intersection of evolutionary algorithms such as genetic programming, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). I am guided by [Prof Jean-Alexis Delamer](https://people.stfx.ca/jdelamer/) and [Prof James Hughes](https://conlabx.com/lab-members/). Previously, I have also worked on problems in adversarial and robust RL along with [Prof Muni Pydi](https://munisreenivas.github.io/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) group at Paris Dauphine University. I was fortunate to spend three wondeful months in Paris supported by the Charpak Scholarship. I am also interested in Computer Vision and have been associated with the [Advanced geometric computing lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html) under [Prof Ramanthan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) at IIT Madras. 

I am actively looking for internships for the summer of 2025. If you'd like to talk to me about anything, get in touch!
